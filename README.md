# Gunpla Asset Management

To address my crippling addiction of gunpla over the past three years, instead of actually trying to stop the addiction I decided to make a inventory/asset management style website that tracks what gunplas I have, the backlog plans that I have, down to the build progress that I made. Which surely I didn't vibe-coded it.

## How it works

This website is self hosted from your local device by using docker desktop. You download this repo and then run it. Usually it doesn't appear in the docker desktop. You need to run `docker compose up -d` in cmd on the folder and it should appear in the docker desktop and from there you can edit or change things from there.
